                                Cold War
A GameJam project by Kayvon Farzaneh, Jared Hettinger, and Ashley Solano

An isolated outpost on Mars is blitzed by snowmen rolling down from the 
Martian mountains. The spacemen are not without defense, but it will take the 
teamwork of their two top generals. Can they overcome their weaknesses and 
lead the spaemen to victory? You decide, in Cold War (in spaceeee).
