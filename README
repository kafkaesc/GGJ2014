                                Cold War
A GameJam project by Kayvon Farzaneh, Jared Hettinger, and Ashley Solano

An isolated outpost on Mars is blitzed by snowgoons rolling down from the 
Martian mountains. The astronauts are not without defense, but it will take 
the teamwork of their two top generals. Can they overcome their weaknesses 
and lead the astronauts to victory? You decide, in Cold War (in spaceeee).
